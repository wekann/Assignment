        "What Is the Hungarian Algorithm?\n",
        "The Hungarian Algorithm (also known as the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm) is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem — matching items in one set to items in another set at minimum total cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Is It Used in Deep SORT?\n",
        "In Deep SORT, the Hungarian algorithm is used to:\n",
        "* Match detected objects (from the current frame)\n",
        "* With existing object tracks (from previous frames)\n",
        "\n",
        "This matching is based on a cost matrix, where:\n",
