        "   #Help with scaling and resource management.\n",
        "\n",
        "# How It Works:\n",
        "   #The server keeps track of how many requests each client (typically identified by an API key, IP address, or user account) makes over time and restricts further requests if the limit is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Common Rate Limiting Strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "   #1 : Fixed Window : Allows a set number of requests per fixed interval (e.g., 100 requests per 60 seconds).\n",
        "   #2 : Sliding Window Log : Logs each request and checks the number within the past time window.\n",
        "   #3 : Token Bucket : Tokens are added at a fixed rate; each request consumes a token.\n",
        "   #4 : Leaky Bucket : Similar to token bucket, but enforces a constant outflow rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Response Headers:\n",
        "  # Many APIs include rate limit information in response headers such as:\n",
        "   #1 : RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed.\n",
        "   #2 : RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests left in the current window.\n",
        "   #3 : RateLimit-Reset`: Time at which the rate limit will reset.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Handling Limits:\n",
        "   #Clients should:\n",
        "   #1Monitor these headers.\n",
