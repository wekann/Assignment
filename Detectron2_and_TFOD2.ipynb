        "What Is a TFRecord File?\n",
        "A TFRecord is a binary file format used by TensorFlow to efficiently store large datasets — especially for tasks like object detection and image classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "It contains a series of serialized `tf.train.Example` protocol buffers, which represent individual data points (e.g., an image + annotations).\n",

        "Why Are TFRecord Files Used in TFOD2?\n",
        "The TensorFlow Object Detection API v2 (TFOD2) expects training data to be in TFRecord format for several important reasons:\n",

        "1. Efficiency & Performance\n",
